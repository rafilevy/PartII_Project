Experiments on lopy4 sleep and deep sleep (pycom) currents:

Voltage / Active Current / Deep Sleep Current:
- 3.3V / 40mA / 0.009mA (Did get down to 0.007 but this wasn't repeatable)
- 3.4V / 41mA / 0.009mA
- 3.5V / 41.5mA / 0.009mA
- 3.7V / 40mA / 0.009mA

For config 4 at 3.3V:
Normal: 39mA / 0.018mA
go_to_sleep(False): 39mA / 0.009mA - 0.010mA after some cycles

For config 3 at 3.3V:
38mA / 4.4mA

For config 2 at 3.3V:
38mA / 7mA 

For config 1 at 3.3V:
