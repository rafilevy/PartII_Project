<!-- Config deep_sleep and deep_sleep_pycom have different idle times. Try to match these up - potential to overlay the graphs if you do. -->

<!-- Deep sleep current on configuration graphs is not dropping as low as it should. -->

<!-- Collect energy cost per byte data for LoRaWAN transmissions. -->

<!-- Collect cost of energy saved per byte of data. -->

Collect graph for batching when it sends data (rather than save it).

Collect graph for prediction configuration.

Experiment with techniques for waking the device using an interrupt generated by a sensor rather than on a fixed interval.
PIR sensors on the C02 sensors.

Recollect data rate data at low interval ~ 30s? Aiming for around 10,000 data points with time included.
