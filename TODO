Config deep_sleep and deep_sleep_pycom have different idle times. Try to match these up - potential to overlay the graphs if you do.

Measure of device current draw when working (looping through large array and multiplying numbers), compare this to time.sleep to prove time.sleep is device idling.

Collect energy cost per byte data for LoRaWAN transmissions.

Collect cost of energy saved per byte of data.

Experiment with techniques for waking the device using an interrupt generated by a sensor rather than on a fixed interval.
PIR sensors on the C02 sensors.

Recollect data rate data at low interval ~ 30s? Aiming for around 10,000 data points with time included.
