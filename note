If rather than an OTAA connections we can hard code the dev addr then we will be able "

OTAA vs ABP:
    When initially using OTAA there was a large delay as it tried to perform an handshake on every connection.
    This took time and was unreliable as to how long it took. The LoPy device was not receiving the downlink messages
    from the gateway which completed the handshake so would be stuck in a loop sending join requests and not receiving 
    the responses until it managed to and connected.

    ABP hard codes the encryption settings so a connection handshake wasn't required. Struggled to get ABP to work on the LoPy
    this could be due to buggy code in the Pycom libraries or issues with the Lopy device itself. When sending data
    either an error would be thrown or the data would seem to send but would not be received by the gateway (which means it
    either wasn't being sent or was with incorrect settings)

    The workaround is to use OTAA to connect when the device is first powered on. It then saves the OTAA credentials in non-volatile
    storage. When it next connects it retreives the credetials so can rejoin the network without performing a handshake again.
